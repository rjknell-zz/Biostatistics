<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Very often we find ourselves dealing with data where there is more than one measurement made on each individual that we are studying, and a lot of the time we are interested in the relationships between these variables — as an example, if we’re studying plant diseases we might want to know whether there is a relationship between the number of leaves showing infection on a plant and the growth rate of the plant, or we might be interested in whether people with an autoimmune disease also have high rates of reactivity to IgA antibodies. When we have <em>bivariate</em> data like this (bivariate meaning that for each individual we have two measurements) we can of course go through our normal exploratory look at each individual variable, using histograms or boxplots to visualise the shape of the distribution and to give us an idea of where the variables are centred and how much spread there is. Once we’ve done that, however, we can go further and look at the two variables together. For numeric data this would usually be done by plotting a <em>scatterplot</em> with one variable on the x-axis and one on the y-axis. Scatterplots are particularly useful tools for exploratory data analysis because you can easily see whether there appears to be any relationship between your variables, you can check for anomalous data, you can see if there is any curvature in the relationship and you can check for any signs of <em>structure</em> or <em>grouping</em> in your data.</p>
<p>Here’s a video which runs through the basics of what scatterplots are and what the common patterns that you might see are.</p>
<p><img src="https://youtu.be/sqVqNygszL0" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-scatterplot-basics" class="section level2">
<h2>Scatterplot basics</h2>
<p>Here’s an example of a scatterplot, and the R code used to draw it. The <code>plot()</code> function in R will generate a scatterplot if you give it two numerical variables. You might notice the way that the two variables are entered as a <em>formula</em> so the y-axis variable comes first, followed by the x-axis one and they are separated by a tilde <code>~</code>. You can also specify <code>x=</code> and <code>y=</code> as separate arguments for a plot and you’ll get the same result. The best thing to do is to pick one method and stick with it so there is no confusion. The data are from a study published by Charters <em>et al.</em> in 2018<sup>1</sup> looking at physical performance in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_quoll">Northern Quolls</a>, a small marsupial predator found in Australia. Note that both grasping force and maximum oxygen uptake have been ‘standardised’ — converted to variables with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1 — this is for a multidimensional analysis that the authors did, but it doesn’t really affect us here except that units don’t really make much sense for these variables.</p>
<p>We start out by loading the data which I have on a web server</p>
<pre class="r"><code>quolls &lt;- read.csv(&quot;http://research.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/r.knell/learnr_data/ChartersetalQuolls.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now to draw the scatterplot/</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(quolls$grasp ~ quolls$Max_O2_consump, #Variables to be plotted
     pch = 16,  #Plot with solid circles for plot characters
     col = &quot;steelblue&quot;, #Nice colour for plotting points
     xlab = &quot;Maximum oxygen consumption&quot;, #x-axis label
     ylab = &quot;Grasping force&quot;, #y-axis label
)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Scatterplots_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="480" /></p>
<p>You can look at this scatterplot and you can see a pattern: the animals with high levels of oxygen consumption have stronger bite forces than do the animals with low levels of oxygen consumption — there is a <em>positive correlation</em>. You can also see that there is a fair amount of noise in the data, so there are some animals with high oxygen consumption and low grasping force, and some with low oxygen consumption and fairly high grapsing forces. Overall though the pattern is reasonably clear (if you’re an ecologist you’d be pleased with this degree of correlation, most physicists on the other hand would give up and do something else if they got data like these). There are no obvious problem data points, and there is no indication of a curved relationship, or any obvious clustering that might indicate groups in the data. I’d happily go on to do further analysis on these data without any concerns.</p>

<h2>Two simple scatterplots</h2>
<p>The data set malawi_carbon contains data on two lung immunity measures (oxidative burst activity and phagocytic activity) from people exposed to chronic carbon particulates in their homes in Malawi. These data were originally published by Rylance <em>et al.</em> (2015)<sup>1</sup> as part of a study of how exposure to smoke from cooking fires affects lung function. Let’s load the data and have a look at how these two variables relate to particulate exposure.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>malawi_carbon &lt;- read.csv(&quot;http://research.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/r.knell/learnr_data/malawi_carbon.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Start with the phagocytic activity data. Use the R code we used in the previous example as a guide. You’ll need to use the <code>plot()</code> function and to specify the x- and y- variables by either putting in a formula of the form <code>y~x</code> or by specifying <code>x=</code> and <code>y=</code> arguments. The variables in question are called <code>log_carbon</code>, which should go on the x-axis, (the carbon data has been log transformed: more on this later) and the variable for the phagocytic activity is called <code>phagocytosis</code> and this should go on the y-axis. Both of them are in the <code>malawi_carbon</code> data frame so you need either to refer to them using the dataframe$variable syntax or just give the names of the variables but add a <code>data = malawi_carbon</code> argument to your function call. Finally, you’ll need to put in some sensible x-axis and y-axis labels using <code>xlab = ""</code> and <code>ylab = ""</code>. I suggest “Log carbon score” for the x-axis and “Phagocytosis activity (%)” for the y-axis — the phagocytosis score is actually a the percentage of macrophages which took up flourescent silica beads.</p>

<p>Have a look at the plot. Do you see any relationship between carbon exposure and phagocytic activity? Are there any clusters of data or obviously problematic data points with unlikely values? Don’t overthink this: your first impressions will probably be correct.</p>
<p>Noew let’s plot our other measure of lung immune function, oxidative burst activity, against carbon score. You can use the same code as before but you need to replace <code>phagocytosis</code> with <code>oxidative_burst</code> and you’ll need a new y-axis label. I suggest “Oxidative burst index”: it doesn’t really have units.</p>

<p>Compare this plot to the previous one. Do they look similar? Is there a pattern in one of them that you don’t see in the other?</p>
<br>
<details>
<p><summary><b>Click here for explanation</b></summary> Neither plot shows a strong pattern, there are no obvious problem data points. Looking at the first there seems to be no relationship between carbon exposure and phagocytic activity, either positive or negative. Looking at the second plot, however, we can see what apppears to be a negative correlation between oxidative burst index and carbon score, with the higher values of oxidative burst activity all being associated with low carbon scores. It’s not clear, and the plot doesn’t give us much confidence that this isn’t simply a consequence of sampling error — it’s possible that the pattern we can see could have arisen simply by chance. For those who are familiar with statistical testing we can look at the significance of the correlation coefficient to give us an indication of how likely this is.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cor.test(malawi_carbon$oxidative_burst, malawi_carbon$log_carbon)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation
## 
## data:  malawi_carbon$oxidative_burst and malawi_carbon$log_carbon
## t = -2.2382, df = 27, p-value = 0.03366
## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -0.66559861 -0.03402465
## sample estimates:
##        cor 
## -0.3955971</code></pre>
The p-value for the correlation is 0.034 which is indeed less than the cut-off for statistical significance at 0.05 so we do have a statistically significant negative correlation. The data are noisy though and the sample size is fairly small so we should be very cautious interpreting this pattern.

<p>Now we’ll use a dataframe loaded called <code>worldbank</code> which has data for 186 countries from 2014 as published by the World Bank. Let’s load the data into R.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>worldbank &lt;- read.csv(&quot;http://research.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/r.knell/learnr_data/worldbank.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>One of the variables is called <code>Forest_area</code> and represents the percentage of the land surface for each nation which is forested. A second variable is called <code>Precipitation</code> and is the annual precipitation in mm. Try drawing a scatterplot of forest area, on the y-axis, versus precipitation on the x-axis. We’ll make the plot look a bit nicer by using filled circles for our plot symbols, which we can do by using the argument <code>pch = 16</code>. We’ll give them some colour as well: I suggest <code>aquamarine4</code> or <code>steelblue</code> which we can specify by using the <code>col = "colour name"</code> argument. Don’t forget those quote marks.</p>

<br>
<details>
<p><summary><b>Click here for explanation</b></summary></p>
The spread of data indicates a positive correlation: in general nations with low percentages of forest cover have low precipitation, and <em>vice-versa</em>. There are no obviously anomalous datapoints (we might look for percentages &lt;0 or &gt;100, or unfeasibly high precipitation). This plot is rather different from the previous one, however, because the amount of dispersion in the data increases as the amount of precipitation increases — when precipitation is low there is very little variance in the data and all the nations with low precipitation have little or no forest cover. This is hardly surprising since these countries are essentially deserts. When precipitation is high, however, there is a complete range of percent forest area, from almost none to close to 100%. This increasing variance (which statisticians refer to by a very polysyllabic word, <em>heteroskedasticity</em>, meaning that the variance is heterogeneous) is a common pattern in all sorts of data and is something that can cause problems with certain analyses, so you need to be aware of it.

<p>When we have data like this then one way to try to make the plot more readable is to <em>log-transform</em> the data, or alternatively to plot it on a log scale. To log transform it you would use the <code>log()</code> function, so your function call might look like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(log(carnivores$Mean_brain_mass_g) 
  ~ log(carnivores$Mean_body_mass_Kg),...</code></pre>
<p>but we’re going to plot the data on a log scale instead. This involves transforming the <em>axes</em> rather than transforming the individual data points, and you can do this in R by adding the <code>log = "xy"</code> argument to your <code>plot()</code> function call. Note that if you just wanted the y-axis on a log scale you could use <code>log = "y"</code> and for just the x-axis <code>log = "x"</code>. Have a go at generating a new plot, but with the axes on a log scale.</p>
<p><em>TIP</em> if you just add the <code>log = "xy"</code> argument R will plot the graph with scientific notation on the x-axis, so 1e+03 instead of 1000. To stop this, insert this before the <code>plot()</code> command:</p>
<p><code>options(scipen = 999)</code></p>
<p>This sets a <em>global option</em> in R and stops it using scientific notation.</p>

<p>You can see that when these data are plotted on a log-log scale (notice how the x-axis ticks go from an increase of 900g between the first and second and 900Kg between the last two) has completely changed the way the data are visualised, and now we have an impressively tight straight line relationship.</p>

<h2>Data with structure</h2>
<p>The longevity dataset has data on maximum recorded lifespan, body mass and various ecological factors for 909 species of birds and mammals, from a publication by Healy <em>et al.</em> (2014)<sup>1</sup>. We’re going to look at the relationship between longevity and body mass for a subset of these data consisting of the data from the mammal orders with more than 30 species represented. This subset of data is in the <code>mammal_longevity</code> data frame which you can load from <a href="http://research.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/r.knell/learnr_data/mammal_longevity.csv" class="uri">http://research.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/r.knell/learnr_data/mammal_longevity.csv</a></p>
<p>The variables you need to plot are <code>maximum_lifespan_yr</code> and <code>mass_g</code>. This time, since the name of the data frame is long and unwieldy, we’ll just use the variable names in the <code>plot()</code> call and then add an argument <code>data = mammal_longevity</code> which will tell R where to look. These data need to be plotted in log space to be visualised as with the previous example, so you’ll need to have the <code>log = "xy"</code> argument in there.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to put some sensible axis names in using <code>xlab =</code> and <code>ylab =</code>. I’d recommend plotting this with the default plot symbols, so you don’t need to specify anything with <code>pch =</code>.</p>

<p>Have a good look at the plot. Is there a relationship? Are there any problem data points? Is there any clustering or other evidence of structure?</p>
<br>
<details>
<p><summary><b>Click here for explanation and more</b></summary> This is kind of a weird plot… there seems to be a positive relationship, but there is something strange going on with some of the data for very small mammals giving a “hump” sticking upwards, and there is a bit of clustering in the rest of the data that might represent some underlying structure there. It’s likely that at least some of this structure reflects the phylogenetic relationships in the mammalia, so let’s see what happens when we colour-code our data by order. This can be done very easily by just adding <code>col = order</code> as an argument to your <code>plot()</code> function call, but you have to remember to declare order as a factor first before you start the <code>plot()</code> function. Use this line of code to do this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mammal_longevity$order &lt;-
  as.factor(mammal_longevity$order)</code></pre>
<p>We will also need a legend so that we know which colour corresponds to which order, and I’ll give you the code for this, which needs to be added after you’ve finished the <code>plot()</code> instruction.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>legend(
  &quot;bottomright&quot;,  #Put the legend in the bottom 
                  #right corner of the plot
  fill = 1:5,     #Filled boxes with colours 1 - 5 from 
                  #the default R colour palette
